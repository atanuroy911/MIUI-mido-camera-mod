DESCRIPTION [COPIED] :

This Mod works on (MIUI ROM, Xiaomi.eu ROM, MultiROM, Epic ROM, MIUIPRO, mi-Globe) :
Stable ROM : MIUI : 8.1.x.0, 8.2.x.0, 8.5.x.0, 9.x.x.0
Developer ROM : MIUI : v7.x.x, 7.12.x, 8.1.x, 8.2.x, 8.3.x

*Previous Updates : 
Add a 'Developer (Dev)' version Mod.
Dev version has an additional feature 'advanced HDR' (Pro & Live HDR mode for Camera & HDR for Video Recording), unfortunatelly HDR mode in video recording is not really stable, but it works, if you like to use it, just remember to turn HDR mode off before switching to front camera or any other camera mode and your MIUI Camera app should be fine.
Add info on how to prevent Bootloop from flashing this Mod to the Q & A section (see the bottom of this post)
Add Auto HDR mode (@Suspect008 said "i can tell u that auto HDR works with samsung too as shown in my pics but in good lighting. going to low light auto HDR seems to mess up the details").
Add info regarding OTA-Update to the Q & A section, please read.
